## Compatability

### Confirmed Working

#### Fans

* DR-HAF001S
* DR-HAF003S
* DR-HAF004S
* DR-HCF003S
* DR-HPF001S
* DR-HPF002S

* DR-HTF002S
* DR-HTF004S
* DR-HTF005S
* DR-HTF007S
* DR-HTF011S

#### Heaters

* DR-HSH004S
* DR-HSH006S
* DR-HSH009S
* â€ŽDR-HSH017S

Please open an issue if you have another model that works or doesn't work. If you have another device type and can help me test some code out I would definitely be open to adding support.

## Supported Features

### Fans

* **Fan Speed:** Fan speed is displayed as a percentage value with steps that are equivalent to those of the Dreo app. (for example, a fan with speeds 1-6 will have steps at 17%, 33%, 50% etc)

* **Oscillate:** Toggles fan oscillation
* **Temperature Sensor:** Displays current temperature sensor reading. (for supported devices, check your devices capabilities) Because the Dreo fan temperature sensors are not entirely accurate, you can also set a specific temperature offset for your devices.
* **Child Lock:** Lock physical fan controls

### Heaters

#### Heaters are displayed as a thermostat accessory with the following control mappings

* **Heat Mode:** Controls Dreo 'Eco' mode
* **Cool Mode:** Controls Dreo 'Fan Only' mode
* **Auto Mode:** Controls Dreo 'Heat' speeds, represented as an offset from the minimum temperature (for example, a heater with speeds 1-3 and a minimum temp of 41F can be controlled by setting temperature to 41, 42, 43)
* **Current Temperature:** Displays current temperature sensor reading
* **Fan Speed:** Controls heater vent angle
* **Oscillate:** Toggles heater vent oscillation
* **Child Lock:** Lock physical heater controls
* **Hardware Display:** Changes temperature unit on physical hardware display

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g homebridge-dreo
```

(Or install through the Homebridge UI)

## Configuration

Provide your Dreo app login credentials

```json
"platforms": [
  {
    "options": {
      "email": "email@example.com",
      "password": "00000000"
    },
    "hideTemperatureSensor": false,
    "temperatureOffset": 0,
    "name": "Dreo Platform",
    "platform": "DreoPlatform"
  }
]
```
